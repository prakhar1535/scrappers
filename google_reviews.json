      "text": "Great food and authentic taste! A very nice brunch/lunch experience and many visitors/locals. Spacious but is vibrant with crowds which is a great thing. Our server Mr. Omar helped us by recommending the food and often attending our table. He was nice and helpful. If you are visiting Citywalk, should pay a visit!",

As for the food, it was truly exceptional‚Äîfresh and delicious, especially the grills and the tabbouleh. The service was also outstanding, and I want to particularly thank Mr. Jamil Kriter for his quick and professional service. He ensured our comfort throughout the visit. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon and highly recommend it to everyone",

The staggered arrival of dishes, with lengthy pauses between courses, disrupted the flow of the meal.\n\nWhile the service could use some refinement, the exceptional food and inviting outdoor atmosphere make it a worthwhile experience for those who are willing to exercise a little patience.",

But I really want to appreciate Mr. Sohaib for his excellent work at the reception and always ensure your order done in timely manner. Once again, thanks Allo Beirut and keep up the excellent work.",

      "text": "Allo Beirut at City Walk is a great spot in the heart of Dubai for a unique take on Lebanese flavors. The staff here are fantastic, friendly, attentive, and quick with service. I ordered the healthy beef shawarma, and the taste was absolutely amazing! The beef was well-seasoned and flavorful, which made every bite enjoyable. However, since it‚Äôs a health-focused option, the shawarma served hot and bread  served cold, which may surprise some. Presentation could use a bit more flair, and no sides were offered, which might leave you wanting just a little extra.\n\nThe location at City Walk is perfect, offering an open, vibrant atmosphere that truly feels like you‚Äôre right in the middle of Dubai. The view is fantastic, adding a great ambiance to the experience. Plus, the restaurant is wheelchair accessible, making it convenient for all visitors.\n\nAllo Beirut offers a delicious meal and a great experience. With slight improvements in presentation, it could easily become a five-star spot!‚Äù",

      "text": "The interior of the restaurant is well done. Very funky and fun. Suits the name. It is spacious and seating is comfortable. Very Kid friendly.\nThis time around the service was a-little slow but the staff was kind enough to make it up to us by giving our babies complementary fruit.\nWe ordered the hummus with pinenuts, mutabal, beef shawarma and mix grill platter. The food was delicious specially the shishtouk kabab. The only draw back is that standard bread served is cold. For hot bread you have to place an order or ask however it should always be served hot.",
